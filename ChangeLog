2002-07-23  Tero Tilus  <terotil@jyu.fi>

	* doc/manual.xml: Manual is now pretty complete.  Minor
	modifications are sure to appear, but all the major features are
	now documented.

2002-07-16  Tero Tilus  <terotil@jyu.fi>

	* ejscc.c: Fixed "multiple assignments with same construction as
	left value" and "global var backdoor".

	* Makefile: Cleaned up release package targets.

2002-07-10  Tero Tilus  <terotil@jyu.fi>

	* ejsc_parser.lex: Added C(++) style //line and /*block*/ comments
	to help nesting comments and commenting out smaller or larger
	portions of text.

2002-07-09  Tero Tilus  <terotil@jyu.fi>

	* ejscc.c: Resolved "multiple calls" -bug.  Introduced another
	one: Variables in "higher" namespaces aren't taken into account
	when checking if user defined construction should be recursed
	into.  

	* ejsc_parser.y: Allow more params and syms

2002-06-10  Tero Tilus  <terotil@jyu.fi>

	* ejscc.c: Changed symTable definition to (tSymbol **) to make
	references to symbols and dynamical symtable allocation possible.

	Various bugfixes

	* ejsc_parser.y: Tuned memory management.

	* ejscc.c: Compiler now detects recursive definitions (and doesn't
	enter infinite loop).

2002-06-06  Tero Tilus  <terotil@jyu.fi>

	* ejsc_parser.y: Tuned memory management a bit.  Dropping MAXVARS
	and MAXARGLISTS to more realistic figures helped a lot.

	* ejscc.c: Compiler crashed on parameterized formats.  Fixed.

2002-06-05  Tero Tilus  <terotil@jyu.fi>

	* ejscc.c: Re-emission tracking is now completely rewritten and
	can _truly_ recognize if a construction has been called with same
	parameters before and doesn't emit it again.

2002-06-04  Tero Tilus  <terotil@jyu.fi>

	* Makefile: Added new targets: source_release and binary_release.
	
	* ejscc: Moved whole the project to CVS version control.

2002-06-03  Tero Tilus  <terotil@jyu.fi>

	* ejscc.c: Fixed bug: '#'-comment didn't work.  It had to be
	written as separate rule.  I think flex can't handle two or more
	nested braces correctly.  in ((one)|(two)) two wasn't recognized
	at all.  Writing them as separate rules solved problem.

2002-05-30  Tero Tilus  <terotil@jyu.fi>

	* Release: 0.1.3

	* Makefile (clean): Cleaning now removes .pp and .jsc -trash from
	test/ directory.

	* ejscc.c: Fixed bugs: crash on user construction with multiple
	parameters, broken emission tracking of user constructions.

2002-05-29  Tero Tilus  <terotil@jyu.fi>

	* ejscc.c (EJSCC_VERSION): Promoted version number to 0.1.3

	* ejsc_parser.lex: Using C preprocessor requires lines beginning
	with '#' to be interpreted as comments.  Added that as an
	alternative (to {}) comment syntax.

2002-05-27  Tero Tilus  <terotil@jyu.fi>

	* ejscc.c: Implemented file IO and C preprocessor (-p switch).

2002-05-20  Tero Tilus  <terotil@jyu.fi>

	* Release: 0.1.2

	* ejscc.c: Parameters now work in user defined constructions (see
	test/features_user-constructions.ejsc).  Lengths of parameter
	lists aren't checked yet.

	* ejsc_parser.lex: Allowed names ending with digit to have spaces
	'&'s and '_'s in them (ie. x_axis_1 is a valid (identifier) name).

	* ejsc_parser.y: Re-emission tracking is now modified to work with
	changing parameter list.  This was required to make user functions
	with parameters work.

	Adjusted definition of 'codeblock' to allow definition on single
	line by adding ';' between 'begin' and 'construction'.  Now
	"MyConstruction() begin x=50; end;" is possible.  Previously
	string after "()" was recognized as name "begin x" and not keyword
	"begin".  Now it's written "MyConstruction() begin; x=50; end;"
	and works as it should.

2002-05-15  Tero Tilus  <terotil@jyu.fi>

	* ejscc.c: Calls to user defined constructions work!  Parameters
	aren't working yet.  Re-emissioin tracking needs polishing to work
	with functions.

	* ejsc_parser.y: Modified definition of argument list.  Now it can
	be empty.

	* ejsc_parser.lex: Added code block keywords 'begin' and 'end'.
	Lexer now recognizes codeblocks and changes currentSym
	accordingly.  Nested codeblocks don't work yet!

2002-05-14  Tero Tilus  <terotil@jyu.fi>

	* ejsc_parser.lex: Added '&' to valid characters in NAME.

2002-05-13  Tero Tilus  <terotil@jyu.fi>

	* Release: 0.1.1

	* ejsc_parser.lex: Bug that gave "syntax error" on valid syntax
	appeared not to be bug, but just a plain typo in lexer.  Now
	digits too (and not only letters) are allowed at the end of names.

	* ejscc.c: Added evalId (and evalId arrays for arguments and
	formats) to tObject and corresponding code to tOb-branch of
	compile_ to keep track on the need of re-emission.  At the same
	time managed to blow up compiler.  Debugging is desperately
	needed.

	* test/features_demo.ejsc (circle_y): Added some constructions to
	test optimizations.

2002-05-10  Tero Tilus  <terotil@jyu.fi>

	* README: Added lex and yacc to compile requirements.

	* ejsc_parser.y: Removed "\n" from "construction" rule.
	Linenumber counter is kept up to date by lexers "Skip whitespace".

	* ChangeLog: Added this changelog.

	* First release (0.1).
