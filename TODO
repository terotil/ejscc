o Assignment operations must not be done during parse! Add
  'assignment' object (or variable type).

o Would symTable be better to implement as linked list or as array of
  pointers?  Using more flexible memory allocation would be nice...

o Command-line options
  - Optional comment stripping/preserving

o Arithmetic (and boolean) expressions

o Control flow constructions
  - conditioning
  - loops

o Setting library directories to be passed to cpp via commandline 
  (cpp -B libdir).
